# 🧪 Challenge 1 — SQL Injection

## Objective

The objective was to exploit a vulnerable SQL input form, retrieve Gordon Brown's password hash, crack the password, log into another system, and locate the Challenge 1 flag.

---

## Step 1: Access the Vulnerable Application

Target:

```text
10.6.6.100
```

Login credentials:

```text
Username: admin
Password: password
```

After logging in:

1. Navigate to **DVWA Security**
2. Set the security level to:

```text
Low
```

3. Click **Submit**

---

## Step 2: Identify the Vulnerable SQL Input

The SQL Injection page contained a User ID input.

A UNION-based SQL injection was used to retrieve information from the application's database.

The results revealed multiple user records, including:

```text
First name: Gordon
Surname: Brown
```

and the associated password hash.

### Key Finding

The application allowed user-controlled input to influence the SQL query.

This is a classic SQL injection vulnerability.

---

## Step 3: Crack Gordon Brown's Password

The retrieved hash was saved locally.

John the Ripper was then used with the RockYou wordlist.

```bash
john --format=raw-md5 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt
```

### Result

```text
Password: abc123
```

---

## Step 4: Access the Remote System

Using the recovered credentials:

```bash
ssh gordonb@172.17.0.2
```

After logging in:

```bash
ls
```

The following file was discovered:

```text
hkxisx.txt
```

The file was opened using:

```bash
cat hkxisx.txt
```

### 🚩 Challenge 1 Result

```text

# 🌐 Challenge 2 — Web Server Directory Listing

## Objective

The objective was to identify directories on the web server that allowed directory listing and locate a flag file.

Target:

```text
http://10.6.6.100
```

---

## Step 1: Perform Directory Enumeration

DIRB was used to enumerate directories.

```bash
dirb http://10.6.6.100 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
```

### Interesting Results

```text
/config/
/docs/
```

Both directories could be accessed through a web browser.

---

## Step 2: Investigate the Directory Listings

I manually navigated to:

```text
http://10.6.6.100/docs/
```

The server displayed an index of files.

Files included:

```text
DVWA_v1.3.pdf
help.html
user_form.html
```

The flag file was:

```text
user_form.html
```

---

## Step 3: Open the Flag File

URL:

```text
http://10.6.6.100/docs/user_form.html
```

### 🚩 Challenge 2 Result

```text
Great work!

You found the flag file for Challenge 2!

The code for this flag is 18xf9-4z
```

### Results Summary

| Flag location        | `/docs/user_form.html` |
| Challenge 2 flag     | `18xf9-4z`             |

---

## 🛡️ Directory Listing Remediation

### 1. Disable Directory Indexing

Configure the web server so directory contents cannot be automatically displayed.

### 2. Use Default Index Files

Use files such as:

```text
index.html
index.php
```

where appropriate.

### Additional Recommendations

* Store sensitive files outside the web root.
* Apply proper file permissions.
* Restrict access using authentication and authorization.
* Regularly scan web servers for exposed files and directories.

# 📁 Challenge 3 — Exploiting Open SMB Shares

## Objective

The objective was to identify an SMB server, enumerate its shares, identify anonymous access, and retrieve the Challenge 3 flag file.

---

## Step 1: Identify an SMB Target

Nmap was used to scan the network.

An interesting host was:

```text
10.6.6.23
```

Relevant open ports:

```text
139/tcp
445/tcp
```

These ports indicated that the system was likely running SMB services.

---

## Step 2: Enumerate SMB Shares

SMB enumeration was performed against the target.

Shares discovered:

```text
homes
workfiles
print$
```

The following shares allowed anonymous access:

```text
workfiles
print$
```

---

## Step 3: Access the SMB Share

I connected to the `print$` share:

```bash
smbclient //10.6.6.23/print$
```

The connection was successful without requiring valid user credentials.

Inside SMBClient:

```text
ls
cd OTHER
ls
```

The following file was discovered:

```text
taxes.txt
```

The file was downloaded:

```text
get taxes.txt
```

After exiting SMBClient:

```bash
cat taxes.txt
```

### 🚩 Challenge 3 Result

```text
Congratulations!
You found the flag for Challenge 3!
The code for this challenge is A9!15wa2.

# 📡 Challenge 4 — Wireshark PCAP Analysis

## Objective

The objective was to analyze the `SA.pcap` capture file and identify the target system and the location of a file containing the Challenge 4 flag.

The PCAP file was located in the Kali user's `OTHER` directory.

---

## Step 1: Open the PCAP File

The capture file was opened in Wireshark.

To focus on web traffic, I used the display filter:

```text
http
```

The HTTP packets revealed communication with:

```text
10.6.6.14
```

---

## Step 2: Analyze Revealed HTTP Paths

The capture revealed several paths, including:

```text
/data
/styles
/passwords
/icons.txt
```

The `/data` directory was particularly interesting.

---

## Step 3: Investigate the Target

Using a browser, I navigated to:

```text
http://10.6.6.14/data/
```

The directory contained:

```text
accounts.xml
```

The full URL was:

```text
http://10.6.6.14/data/accounts.xml
```

The XML file contained account-related information.

### 🚩 Challenge 4 Results

| Finding          | Result               |
| ---------------- | -------------------- |
| Target IP        | `10.6.6.14`          |
| Flag Directory   | `/data/`             |
| Flag File        | `accounts.xml`       |
| Full URL         | `/data/accounts.xml` |
| Challenge 4 Flag | `zz90014x`           |

---

## 🛡️ Clear-Text Traffic Remediation

### 1. Use HTTPS / TLS

Sensitive information should never be transmitted over plain HTTP.

Use:

```text
HTTPS
```

instead of:

```text
HTTP
```

### 2. Use a VPN for Untrusted Networks

A VPN can provide an additional encrypted communication channel.

### Additional Recommendations

* Encrypt sensitive data in transit.
* Encrypt sensitive files at rest.
* Avoid storing sensitive information in web-accessible directories.
* Require authentication for sensitive resources.
* Use strong authorization controls.
* Avoid transmitting credentials in clear text.

# 📚 What I Learned

This capstone helped me connect multiple cybersecurity concepts into one practical penetration testing workflow.

## Key Takeaways

### 🔹 Reconnaissance is the foundation

Scanning and enumeration provide the information needed to decide what to investigate next.

### 🔹 Small misconfigurations can create serious exposure

Examples from this lab included:

* Directory listing
* Anonymous SMB access
* Sensitive files in accessible directories
* Clear-text HTTP traffic

### 🔹 Weak passwords are still dangerous

A password hash does not guarantee security when the original password is weak and easily guessable.

### 🔹 Encryption protects data in transit

HTTP traffic can expose sensitive information to anyone capable of observing network traffic.

### 🔹 Exploitation is only one part of penetration testing

A complete assessment also includes:

```text
Discovery
→ Validation
→ Impact Analysis
→ Evidence Collection
→ Remediation
```

# 🏁 Conclusion

This Final Capstone Activity provided a practical experience of how a penetration test can move from reconnaissance to exploitation and finally to remediation.

The four challenges demonstrated how different weaknesses can expose sensitive information:

```text
SQL Injection
      +
Directory Listing
      +
Anonymous SMB Access
      +
Clear-Text HTTP Traffic
      =
Increased Security Risk
```

The most valuable lesson from this lab was understanding that cybersecurity is not about using a single tool or finding a single vulnerability.

It is about following a structured methodology:

```text
Observe → Enumerate → Analyze → Validate → Document → Remediate
```

This hands-on practice strengthened my understanding of both offensive techniques and defensive security controls.
